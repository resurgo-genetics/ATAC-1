# ATAC
Code and documentation for analysis of ATAC-seq data

This repo is organized into:
  - master branch, containing all scripts generated to date 
  - Would like to organize into these sub-folders, but can't figure out how to get those to sync with Rstudio:
      + mapping
      + viz files
      + peaks
      + qc plots
  -   the master branch may have sub-branches, which represent alternative ways to analyse the raw data 
  - analysis branches, containing subsets of the master sample set, 
      + analyses will be based off of the files generated in the master branch, or one of its sub-branches
  -
